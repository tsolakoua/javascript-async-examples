## JavaScript async examples 

In this repository we load an HTML page with a list of travel APIs in order to get familiar with the asynchronous behavior of JavaScript. 

In the `simple.js` you will notice that the new added API is not loaded in the HTML. How can we make it work?

For this scenario we will build working examples with callbacks, promises and async / await syntax. 

### How to run the examples

- Edit the `<script src="async.js"></script>` of the `index.html` in order to run the script you want
- There are the following examples: `simple.js`, `callback.js`, `promises.js` and `async.js`
